## Does CWLTool Work?

First things first, we will check it cwltool is properly installed.

Command: Running the cwltool and asking it to print its version.
```
(cwl) niels@ESLT0051:~$ cwltool --version
```

Output: something like
```
/home/niels/.virtualenvs/cwl/bin/cwltool 1.0.20161007181528
```

If this fails see https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool for installation instructions, usually as simple as

```
pip install cwltool
```
